# pleant-leave-detection
The central goal of this project is to implement SVM and CNN algorithms capable of diagnosing plant disease from images taken by hand-held devices in the field. 
An Android application is implemented to present results to the user based on the model. So that users can take photos of the maize leaf and upload photos to the application to get results on whether the plant is infected.
This respository is for software part only.
